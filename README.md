This study focuses on evaluating and comparing two machine learning models for RUL prediction using the C-MAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset, developed by engineers at NASA to support research in predictive maintenance. The C-MAPSS dataset simulates run-to-failure scenarios for turbofan engines and contains multivariate time-series data, including sensor readings and operational settings recorded over each engineâ€™s life cycle
